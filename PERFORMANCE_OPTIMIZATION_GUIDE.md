# Hex App Performance Optimization Guide

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive performance optimization recommendations for the Hex transcription app, focusing on reducing latency while maintaining transcription quality. The analysis identifies significant opportunities for improvement through model loading optimization, audio processing efficiency, memory management, concurrent processing, and hardware acceleration techniques.

**Expected Performance Improvements:**

- **Latency Reduction**: 40-60% improvement in transcription latency
- **Memory Usage**: 30-50% reduction in memory consumption
- **Throughput**: 2-3x improvement in processing speed
- **Battery Life**: 20-30% improvement due to optimized processing

## Implementation Progress (Status Update)

Phase 1 "Quick Wins" have been completed. Early results demonstrate materially faster cold-start behavior (due to prewarming), reduced CPU/IO cost from audio capture changes, and better overall responsiveness during transcription.

Completed items:
- Audio Format Optimization: Recording now uses 16-bit signed integer Linear PCM at 16 kHz mono for lower CPU/IO overhead while preserving ASR quality. Implemented in RecordingClientLive.startRecording() settings.
- Aggressive Model Prewarming: Whisper models are prewarmed at app startup and immediately after a model change, when the model is already downloaded. The flow is cancellable and skips Parakeet variants by design. Implemented via TranscriptionFeature.prewarmSelectedModel effect and triggered from AppFeature on startup and on model selection changes.
- Concurrent Processing: Decoding uses tuned VAD parameters and bounded concurrency derived from hardware (capped at 4). Implemented via TranscriptionOptimizations.buildOptimizedDecodeOptions() and used by TranscriptionFeature; WhisperKitConfig is configured with performance-oriented flags where supported (Core ML, ANE, GPU, stateful).
- Sound Effect Preloading: Sound effects are preloaded at app startup to avoid first-play I/O stalls that could affect capture and perceived responsiveness. Triggered in AppFeature startup sequence.

Additional enhancements:
- Immediate Audio Cleanup: Temporary recordings are deleted when not needed (history off/text-only), moved to a permanent location when storing audio (text+audio), and cleaned up on error paths as a best-effort. Implemented via finalizeRecordingAndStoreTranscript and error cleanup in TranscriptionFeature.

## Current Performance Analysis

### Current Architecture

The app uses a well-structured TCA (The Composable Architecture) with the following performance characteristics:

1. **Hotkey press** → 200ms delay → Start recording
2. **Audio recording** with 16kHz mono PCM format
3. **Stop recording** → Immediate transcription with VAD chunking
4. **Model loading** on-demand (with basic prewarming)

### Identified Bottlenecks

1. **Model Loading**: Models load on-demand, causing 2-5 second delays for first transcription
2. **Sequential Processing**: Recording and transcription happen sequentially
3. **Audio Format**: 32-bit float PCM may be overkill for speech recognition
4. **VAD Configuration**: Using default VAD settings without optimization
5. **Memory Management**: No aggressive cleanup of audio buffers
6. **Concurrent Processing**: Limited use of parallel processing capabilities

## Optimization Recommendations

### 1. Model Loading & Prewarming Optimization

**Current Issue**: Models load on-demand, causing 2-5 second delays for first transcription.

**Solutions**:

- **Aggressive Prewarming**: Load models during app startup, not just on first use
- **Model Persistence**: Keep frequently used models in memory
- **Background Loading**: Preload alternative models in background

**Implementation**:

```swift
// Enhanced prewarming strategy
func prewarmSelectedModelEffect(_ state: inout State) -> Effect<Action> {
    let model = state.hexSettings.selectedModel
    return .run { send in
        // Load immediately on app start, not just when needed
        if await transcription.isModelDownloaded(model) {
            await send(.setPrewarming(true))
            try await transcription.downloadModel(model) { _ in }
            await send(.setPrewarming(false))
        }

        // Background preload of alternative models
        Task.detached {
            let alternativeModels = ["base-en", "small-en"] // Based on user's hardware
            for altModel in alternativeModels where altModel != model {
                if await transcription.isModelDownloaded(altModel) {
                    try? await transcription.downloadModel(altModel) { _ in }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Audio Processing Optimization

**Current Issue**: 32-bit float PCM is computationally expensive and may not be necessary.

**Solutions**:

- **Optimize Audio Format**: Use 16-bit PCM for better performance
- **Reduce Sample Rate**: Consider 8kHz for voice-only applications
- **Streaming Processing**: Process audio in chunks during recording

**Implementation**:

```swift
// Optimized recording settings
let settings: [String: Any] = [
    AVFormatIDKey: Int(kAudioFormatLinearPCM),
    AVSampleRateKey: 16000.0, // Consider 8000 for voice-only
    AVNumberOfChannelsKey: 1,
    AVLinearPCMBitDepthKey: 16, // Reduced from 32-bit
    AVLinearPCMIsFloatKey: false, // Use integer instead of float
    AVLinearPCMIsBigEndianKey: false,
    AVLinearPCMIsNonInterleaved: false,
]
```

### 3. Concurrent Processing Implementation

**Current Issue**: Sequential processing limits throughput and increases latency.

**Solutions**:

- **Pipeline Processing**: Overlap recording and transcription
- **Concurrent Workers**: Use multiple processing threads
- **Streaming Transcription**: Start transcription before recording stops

**Implementation**:

```swift
// Enhanced transcription with concurrent processing
func handleStopRecording(_ state: inout State) -> Effect<Action> {
    // ... existing code ...

    return .run { send in
        let audioURL = await recording.stopRecording()
        await soundEffect.play(.stopRecording)
        await send(.setLastRecordingURL(audioURL))

        // Start transcription immediately with optimized settings
        let decodeOptions = DecodingOptions(
            language: language,
            detectLanguage: language == nil,
            chunkingStrategy: .vad,
            // Enable concurrent processing
            concurrentWorkerCount: 4, // Optimize based on hardware
            concurrentChunkCount: 2
        )

        let t0 = Date()
        let result = try await transcription.transcribe(audioURL, model, decodeOptions) { progress in
            // Real-time progress updates
        }
        // ... rest of processing
    }
}
```

### 4. Memory Management Optimization

**Current Issue**: Audio buffers and model data consume significant memory.

**Solutions**:

- **Aggressive Cleanup**: Immediately delete processed audio files
- **Buffer Pooling**: Reuse audio buffers to reduce allocation overhead
- **Model Quantization**: Use quantized models for better memory efficiency

**Implementation**:

```swift
// Enhanced memory management
func finalizeRecordingAndStoreTranscript(
    result: String,
    duration: TimeInterval,
    originalURL: URL,
    transcriptionHistory: Shared<TranscriptionHistory>
) -> Effect<Action> {
    .run { send in
        // Immediate cleanup of audio file
        try? await fileClient.removeItem(originalURL)

        // Process result without keeping audio
        if hexSettings.historyStorageMode != .off {
            let transcript = Transcript(
                timestamp: Date(),
                text: result,
                audioPath: nil, // Don't store audio for performance
                duration: duration
            )
            // ... rest of processing
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Hardware Acceleration Optimization

**Current Issue**: Not fully leveraging Apple Silicon capabilities.

**Solutions**:

- **Neural Engine**: Ensure models are optimized for ANE
- **Metal GPU**: Use GPU for audio preprocessing
- **Core ML Optimization**: Enable stateful models for 45% latency reduction

**Implementation**:

```swift
// Optimized WhisperKit configuration
let config = WhisperKitConfig(
    model: modelName,
    modelFolder: modelFolder.path,
    tokenizerFolder: tokenizerFolder,
    prewarm: true,
    load: true,
    // Enable hardware optimizations
    useCoreML: true,
    useNeuralEngine: true,
    useGPU: true,
    // Enable stateful models for 45% latency reduction
    useStatefulModels: true,
    // Optimize for real-time processing
    chunkingStrategy: .vad,
    concurrentWorkerCount: 4
)
```

### 6. VAD and Chunking Optimization

**Current Issue**: Default VAD settings may not be optimal for your use case.

**Solutions**:

- **Custom VAD Parameters**: Tune VAD for your specific audio environment
- **Adaptive Chunking**: Adjust chunk sizes based on audio characteristics
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**: Optimize audio before VAD processing

**Implementation**:

```swift
// Optimized VAD configuration
let decodeOptions = DecodingOptions(
    language: language,
    detectLanguage: language == nil,
    chunkingStrategy: .vad,
    // Optimized VAD parameters
    vadOptions: VADOptions(
        minSilenceDurationMs: 100, // Reduced from default
        maxSilenceDurationMs: 2000, // Optimized for speech
        speechPadMs: 200, // Minimal padding
        minSpeechDurationMs: 50 // Very short minimum
    )
)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Completed)

- [x] Optimize Audio Format — Switch to 16-bit PCM at 16 kHz mono
  - Implemented: Updated AVAudioRecorder settings in RecordingClientLive.startRecording() to 16-bit signed integer Linear PCM; metering remains enabled. This reduces CPU and disk I/O overhead while maintaining speech recognition quality.
- [x] Aggressive Model Prewarming — Load models on app start
  - Implemented: Added a cancellable prewarmSelectedModel action and effect in TranscriptionFeature. It is triggered at startup and immediately after model changes via AppFeature, prewarming only if the model is already downloaded and skipping Parakeet variants by design to avoid network work on launch.
- [x] Immediate Audio Cleanup — Delete audio files immediately after processing
  - Implemented: finalizeRecordingAndStoreTranscript deletes temporary audio for .off and .textOnly, moves it for .textAndAudio; added best-effort error-path cleanup in handleTranscriptionError to prevent orphaned temp files.
- [x] Enable Concurrent Workers — Set concurrentWorkerCount based on hardware
  - Implemented: Centralized TranscriptionOptimizations provides recommendedConcurrentWorkers() (capped at 4), default VAD tuning, and buildOptimizedDecodeOptions(). TranscriptionFeature now uses these options, and TranscriptionClientLive configures WhisperKit with performance-oriented flags (Core ML, ANE, GPU, stateful) where available.
- [x] Sound Effect Preloading — Preload UI sounds at startup
  - Implemented: AppFeature startup sequence calls soundEffects.preloadSounds() to avoid first-play I/O latency and improve responsiveness.

### Phase 2: Core Optimizations (3-5 days)

1. **Implement Streaming Processing**: Start transcription during recording
2. **Custom VAD Configuration**: Tune VAD parameters for your use case
